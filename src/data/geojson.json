        "descriptions": "Iber\u00e1 is one of the planet\u2019s great freshwater wetlands, covering more than 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) of grasslands and marsh in northeastern Argentina's Corrientes Province. The landscape is a mix of swamps, bogs and rivers and is the second-largest wetland in the world. Iber\u00e1 also supports unique wildlife, including more than 360 species of birds and large mammals like the jaguar.Since the late 1990s, the Conservation Land Trust\u2013Argentina and Douglas and Kristine Tompkins, the founders of Tompkins Conservation, have acquired more than 160,000 hectares in the Iber\u00e1 watershed for two purposes: to expand the area under protection and to support sustainable agriculture.The restoration of Iber\u00e1 has required creative action to secure its long-term ecological integrity. Throughout the 20th century, Iber\u00e1 was extensively degraded by cattle ranching and commercial plantations of non-native species. During decades of careless land use, several species native to Iber\u00e1 disappeared, like the extinct glaucous macaw, the jaguar, the giant river otter, the collared peccary, the tapir, and the pampas deer.With this history in mind, the primary goal of the Iber\u00e1 project is to expand and upgrade conservation protections for the Iber\u00e1 Natural Reserve, a protected area designated by the provincial government of Corrientes in 1983. The Reserve\u2019s boundaries follow the borders of the\u00a0Iber\u00e1 drainage basin. The convergence of Iber\u00e1's hydrological and administrative boundaries has facilitated its protection. If its restoration is taken seriously, the Iber\u00e1 region has great potential to develop a strong\u00a0local economy\u00a0based on the sustainable use of natural resources, primarily ecotourism. Thanks to the work of the Reserve authorities, many species of flora and fauna have spectacularly recovered after suffering from decades of degradation and poor land use. But there is still room for progress.Currently, the Reserve is 40% public land and 60% private property controlled by some 1,800 landowners. Through habitat acquisition, restoration projects, public outreach, and legal activism, the CLT\u2013Argentina team has worked for 15 years to strengthen the public core of the reserve, increase local support for conservation, defend the region against ecological threats, and restore wildlife populations. CLT biologists have successfully reintroduced giant anteaters, a native species that had been absent from the Iber\u00e1 area for decades, have helped to bolster the population of pampas deer, and are working to restore jaguars and other missing species to the Iber\u00e1.One key element of the conservation program is to spread biodiversity-friendly management techniques on agricultural land throughout the Iber\u00e1 watershed. Consistent with a core-buffer-corridor model of landscape conservation, the various ranches owned by CLT in the watershed buffer the core protected areas from negative outside influences, while also modeling good environmental stewardship to neighboring landowners. The ongoing work to expand wildlands, create broad public support for conservation, and support a vibrant agrarian economy has achieved significant progress.\u00a0The next step is the creation of an \"Iber\u00e1 National Park\" that would unite the Reserve with land owned by CLT. In 2016, Mauricio Macri, the President of Argentina, accepted a donation of over 150,000 hectares from CLT, along with another 40,000 hectares in 2017. An\u00a0Iber\u00e1 National Park that encompasses over 700,000 hectares of completely restored land is well within reach.",

Founded in 2013, TexBel currently operates three farms in Belize, for a total of 1,214 hectares, and is one of the largest producer of Valencia oranges and White Marsh grapefruits in Belize. It will bring new revenues to farmers and encourage the plantation of millions of hybrid coconut trees, by renovating thousands of hectares of degraded orchards. Through a coconut and lime intercropped agroforestry model, TexBel is renovating degraded citrus orchards affected by citrus greening, or HLB, disease, a major threat to Belize's rural communities and its important citrus industry. TexBel's innovative model of citrus growing creates resilient systems that more effectively fight off the disease and protect local livelihoods.Since August 2016, Moringa, an Initiative 20x20 financial partner, has financed the development of TexBel's own processing facility. The investment will enable TexBel to use innovative techniques, like high pressure processing, to export fresh, non-pasteurized and ready-to-drink coconut water, as well as fresh lime. The company benefits from its strategic location and the infrastructure of Belize, which is close to key markets like the United States and Mexico. TexBel produces 80 million limes, 10-12 million coconuts, 10 million pounds of oranges, 4 million pounds of grapefruit, and 420,000 pounds of soursup, making it an industry leader in Belize. The global coconut water industry is growing quickly and is expected to expand to $2.5 billion by 2024. By becoming the first large-scale coconut water processing facility in Belize, TexBel aims to tap into this booming market. Crucially, Texbel sources coconuts from a significant number of smallholders and deploys an outgrower program, helping local farmers tap into the global coconut water supply chain. TexBel is also the first Belizean company to have obtained the Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certification for its citrus, a sustainable agriculture and quality label qualifying its products for export. TexBel train local farmers in sustainable agronomic practices, which allow them to sell their fruit to TexBel for processing and to directly benefit from the higher prices that sustainable crops bring. TexBel aims to expand its current footprint throughout Belize and its outgrower network to make the sustainable coconut and citrus industry a success.",

This area contributes to a bi-national protected area network spanning 2.89 million ha\u00a0that includes Madidi National Park in Bolivia and Tambopata National Reserve in Peru. As the largest municipal conservation area in the country, the declaration of Bajo Madidi is a conservation milestone for Bolivia.\u00a0About 40 percent of the area is intact tropical forest, and another 30 percent\u00a0is among the most pristine savanna in the Amazon.\u00a0Located in the municipality of Ixiamas, Bajo Madidi provides a critical refuge for wildlife such as the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata), and marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus). These species \u2013 along with the many others found within the area \u2013 depend on the preservation of large, healthy landscapes for their survival. While grassland and wetland ecosystems across South America have suffered from unsustainable development, those\u00a0found within Bajo Madidi are intact thanks to the area's remoteness.\u00a0In addition to drawing tourists attracted to northwestern Bolivia\u2019s raw beauty, the creation of\u00a0Bajo Madidi will preserve traditional economic practices, including the sustainable harvest of fruits, nuts, and herbs, most notably\u00a010 percent of the world\u2019s brazil nut trees under production.\u00a0The area\u2019s creation will also ensure the protection of the six rivers that flow through Bajo Madidi, which are important for the migration of fish, birds, and other animals.

Novo Campo aims to prove that sustainable small-to-medium-sized ranches that implement a package of better animal nutrition, husbandry, and health policies are profitable and can help restore degraded land.Novo Campo was started in response to the expansion of unsustainable cattle ranching, a process that plays a significant role in the destruction and degradation of the Brazilian Amazon. Today, due in part to lack of focused investment in maintaining ecosystem functionality, pastureland and soils have been degraded, threatening agriculture throughout the region. On top of that, productivity is low and output is falling short of market expectations. Large swathes of the Amazon are caught in a low investment and poor performance trap.The result has been extensive forest clearance and, with it, the loss of biodiversity and ecosystems that underpin rural economies, as well as significant greenhouse gas emissions. The Brazilian cattle sector is now facing pressure from two conflicting forces. On the one hand, the industry is expanding to meet the increasing demand for beef, largely fueled by growing meat consumption in Asia and elsewhere. On the other hand, pressure from powerful clients and civil society organizations is pushing the cattle industry to remove deforestation from its supply chain, and to improve both product quality and sustainabilityIn this complicated sector, the Novo Campo project offers a compelling alternative vision that promotes sustainable cattle ranching. To boost the program, ICV has launched PECSA, Pecu\u00e1ria Sustent\u00e1vel da Amaz\u00f4nia (Amazon Sustainable Cattle Ranching), as the technical assistance, management and investment aggregation firm in charge of Novo Campo. Eventually, PECSA will operate more than 100,000 hectares of pastureland and 340,000 head of environmentally compliant, high-quality beef cattle.To accomplish its ambitious goal, PECSA allied with [AF, an impact investor and financial partner of Initiative 20x20 that argues that financial performance can be aligned with environmental stewardship and social development. Althelia has provided PECSA with 11.5 million euros of financing to start operations on 20 farms, restore 10,000 hectares of pastureland, and sustainably manage 34,000 head of cattle by 2017. The partnership has already paid off. After going through a rigorous certification process in 2017, PECSA was recognized as the first cattle ranching B Corp in Latin America.Althelia\u2019s investment has enabled ranchers to revitalize pastureland and restore riparian forests, to implement rotational grazing systems, to improve health and animal welfare, to provide technical assistance, and to enable market access. PECSA and individual cattle ranchers share the profits of their partnership, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Novo Campo project.The end goal of Novo Campo is to produce fully traceable, forest-friendly beef and significant progress has already been made. The results of the pilot project speak for themselves: For participating ranchers, their methane emissions are down and their stocking per hectare, productivity, meat quality, and gross profit are all up. It's a system that emits less and produces more, without any deforestation.The Novo Campo project also contributes to the State of Mato Grosso's sustainability goals and its REDD+ program. Novo Campo's framework can be expanded to livestock outfits across Mato Grosso, where ranchers own over 30 million head of cattle, and over 10,000 hectares of degraded pastureland in critical riparian areas will benefit from reforestation. As it expands, the program will be a fundamental step towards the realization of fully traceable zero-deforestation beef.\u00a0The outcome? Improved pastureland, productivity, animal welfare and product quality. Another bonus? The end of deforestation and restoration of degraded land in one of the world's most important ecosystems.",

The unquenchable demand for heart of palm\u00a0became so intense that\u00a0some heart of palm species almost went extinct.

        "descriptions": "In Brazil, demand for palm oil is growing. Rising import costs have spurred domestic production, generally using non-native African species. The result is that\u00a0large tracts of forested land are being cleared for monoculture oil palm\u00a0plantations.\u00a0This expansion of this\u00a0type of plantation\u00a0negatively impacts the environment,\u00a0causing land degradation and deforestation. The native Brazilian\u00a0maca\u00faba palm tree, in contrast, when it is planted\u00a0in silvopasture systems on existing cattle pasture causes no degradation or deforestation.\u00a0The trees\u00a0also provide shade for cattle, all without harming yields. INOCAS, a pioneering\u00a0Brazilian start-up implementing this innovative\u00a0maca\u00faba silvopasture system\u00a0is pioneering a\u00a0sustainable alternative to traditional monoculture palm plantations.INOCAS trains smallholder cattle farmers to harvest maca\u00faba palms on their land. Farmers are paid for both their labor during the maca\u00faba\u00a0harvest and for the amount of crop that they grow, potentially doubling their annual income.\u00a0Even though maca\u00faba naturally flourishes in the Cerrado ecosystem\u00a0and can be integrated into agroforestry and silvopasture systems, it has until now remained largely unexplored, as\u00a0it has lacked a structured commercial value chain. INOCAS\u00a0intends to change that: it will process the maca\u00faba fruit into plant oil, animal feed and a dense biomass granulate\u00a0and sell these products to meet growing demand for palm products in Brazil.\u00a0Crucially, INOCAS could potentially produce enough palm oil to sustainably meet rising domestic and global demand without any additional forest clearing or land degradation. Plus, the project was certified by an independent research group\u00a0from\u00a0Leuphana University, which was supported by\u00a0EUR 2.7 million of funding from the European Union.Planting trees on\u00a0a\u00a0third of the\u00a0Alto Parana\u00edba region in\u00a0Minas Gerais State\u00a0would be sufficient to meet the\u00a0entire\u00a0demand for imported\u00a0palm oil in all of Brazil. The long-term maca\u00faba production potential in Brazil exceeds current global palm oil production volume\u00a0and could therefore become a sustainable way of meeting a large proportion of global\u00a0demand. Put another way, if INOCAS\u00a0is successful, it\u00a0could dramatically disrupt the global palm oil market, a leading cause of deforestation and carbon emissions in tropical countries.INOCAS's\u00a0project is located in an area where smallholder farmers and agricultural laborers suffer from both low incomes and\u00a0high seasonal unemployment.\u00a0Since the maca\u00faba harvest season does not conflict with the important\u00a0coffee harvesting season, the project will increase the incomes of local people\u00a0by providing employment during what was previously the\u00a0agricultural down season. Through its extensive tree planting,\u00a0the project\u00a0is also expected to sequester around 600,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, avoid further emissions from deforestation, and reduce pressure\u00a0on a region suffering from high\u00a0rates of deforestation. [AF, an Initiative 20x20 financial partner,\u00a0provided\u00a0a bridge loan to INOCAS\u00a0to kick-start the 2016 harvest season and\u00a0has advised\u00a0the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank on a planned equity investment in order to implement the first phase of the project.\u00a0Althelia will help organize\u00a0the value chain for the maca\u00faba palm fruit, commercialize\u00a0the products, and finance the\u00a0planting of\u00a02,000 hectares of maca\u00faba palm trees on smallholder pastures. The ultimate aim is to reach commercial viability, at a large scale, so that maca\u00faba becomes a credible deforestation-free alternative to African palm oil monocultures.",

This hardy tree\u00a0not only grows in dense closed forests, it also acts as a pioneer species that can help colonize\u00a0degraded and deforested areas, helping other species take root. The babassu is also an economic asset:\u00a0Its coconuts\u00a0produce rich oil and\u00a0strong plant fiber.\u00a0From the late 1980s, however, babassu production has\u00a0suffered a continual decline. The spread of intensive agriculture and livestock production destroyed the baba\u00e7uais forests,\u00a0and the introduction of cheap, imported\u00a0palm oil from Asian producers replaced babassu oil as the key ingredient in Brazil's\u00a0personal care, perfumery and cosmetics industry. Some local producers closed down, threatening the livelihoods of the more than 200,000 people who depended on the babassu industry.Tobasa Bioindustrial de Baba\u00e7u, a certified B Corporation,\u00a0was founded in the late 1960s\u00a0with a mission to invest in new\u00a0technologies to make babassu coconut production more efficient.

For Tobasa, less\u00a0waste means more profit and less environmental impact.Today, Tobasa is the only industrial complex of its kind in Brazil. The company produces activated carbon for use in residential and industrial water filters, bioalcohol for use in the cosmetic and beverage industries, and other babassu by-products like meal, which is used for animal feed.To ensure that its supply is both of good quality and consistent, Tobasa works closely with the local communities who harvest babassu palms. Babassu harvesters formerly could only sell the valuable inner nut, which is only 6 percent\u00a0of the total mass of the coconut, but, thanks to technological innovation,\u00a0Tobasa can now use the entire coconut to produce goods for the market. By\u00a0buying\u00a0the whole coconuts, both the nut and the shell,\u00a0Tobasa ensures that farmers get the most out of what they harvest. Kaet\u00e9 Investimentos, an Initiative 20x20 financial partner, became a partner of Tobasa in 2016. Through its Multi-Strategy Sustainable Investment Fund for the Amazon, Kaet\u00e9 has invested R$8 million (US$2.2 million) in the project, with the objective of improving the industrial process and increasing production capacity. Kaet\u00e9's investment has allowed Tobasa to expand its operations and the number of its babassu harvesters it works with. As of 2018, Tobasa now buys babassu coconuts from over 120,000 hectares in the region, benefitting thousands of local producers. Since 2016 alone, its reach has expanded by 60 percent, and the company has begun to work with an additional 1,500 families. The more babassu that local communities produce, the more income they generate. In this way, Tobasa indirectly incentivizes farmers to plant trees and restore degraded land throughout the region. The area managed by the Tobasa-affiliated communities already stores more than 19 million tons of CO2 and sequesters an additional 1 million tons per year. If more land is restored to meet growing domestic demand for plant oils, more carbon will be stored and more communities will benefit.",

One innovative timber company, Initiative 20x20 technical partner Symbiosis Investimentos, however, is restoring this fragile ecosystem while meeting rising global timber demand.Over 553 hectares of land, Symbiosis has developed an innovative forestry system centered on planting high value commercial hardwood species, site-specific and native to the Atlantic Rain Forest, in combination with other tropical species. These other species have faster initial growth rates that provide partial shade for native species to flourish, control invasive grass species and generate early-stage revenue. The combination of tree species also provides habitat for endangered and threatened species.Symbiosis recognizes that timber demand will only increase in the coming years. By planting biodiverse plantations of high-value hardwoods, the company can redirect pressure away from the few remaining primary forest and avoid further deforestation throughout Brazil. And Symbiosis doesn't only produce timber: For every three hectares planted for wood production, it conserves or restores two additional hectares. To reach that ambitious restoration goal, Symbiosis has established the first commercial plant breeding program for native species in Brazil and has collected a variety of species and genetic types to maximize biodiversity and ecosystem services. Now, the nursery produces over 500,000 seedlings per year.By creating a business model that proves that high-value tree species can be produced on restored land, Symbiosis could revolutionize Brazil's timber industry. Symbiosis isn't stopping with the 1,500 hectares it currently owns. In 2019, it aims to cultivate a further 100 hectares and expand to a total of 5,000 hectares in the coming years.",

        "descriptions": "In Brazil's Sao Paulo State, years of monoculture agriculture and unsustainable grazing have damaged the landscape, lowering crop yields and threatening the local way of life. Without trees to hold the soil in place, local rivers have silted up and jeopardized the water supply. The result? Farmers and ranchers are struggling. One Brazilian company is helping reverse that trend.Futuro Florestal, founded in 2006, grows high-value tropical timber species for the market alongside crops like coffee, cocoa, and a\u00e7a\u00ed. The company plans, manages, and advises commercial reforestation and agroforestry projects that use both native and exotic species to transform degraded landscapes. Their goal? Create thriving landscapes that provide economic opportunity for local people while protecting and restoring farms and forests.Today, the company, supported by the\u00a0Verena Project, directly manages 500 ha and provides technical support across 4,000 further ha with its permanent staff of 25 people. One of its most innovative test plots mixes peach palm, a food crop that is native to the region, with hardwood species, including the native jequitib\u00e1 rosa and guanandi. The peach palms help farmers earn revenue beginning in the second year of the project while they wait for the high-value hardwood to mature over 20 to 25 years. The farmers then selectively harvest some trees while leaving many standing.Futuro Florestal made the commitment to grow native trees not only because they wanted to ensure that these threatened species survive and continue to protect the region's biodiversity, but also because it makes economic sense. These rare woods are becoming increasingly valuable on the market as supplies dwindle while demand for the furniture, flooring, wood artifacts, musical instruments made from them continues to increase. Sustainable plantations like these can protect the remaining native specimens in the few remaining intact expanses of the vulnerable Atlantic Forest.This is a Brazilian solution to a Brazilian problem. As the vast majority of this timber is consumed within Brazil, planting these species on farms closer to large cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo decreases the carbon footprint of shipping timber while also restoring land near these major population centers. With the creation of these new forestry and agroforestry projects came jobs. Futuro Florestal trained 60 people used to conventional (and damaging) coffee and cattle farming to grow native trees and restore the land. Local communities had the opportunity to participate in courses, lectures, workshops and field days that the company conducted on the farms. They worked with schools, universities and individuals to show that environmental and economic sustainability can come hand-in-hand.What impact has Futuro Florestal had so far? Since the company started growing trees, the landscape produces four times more water than before, securing this key resource for the company's nurseries and nearby farmers. The soil is healthier, and native animals like pumas, otters, and birds have returned to the property. And more carbon is now stored in the plants and soil than before. A bright future awaits Brazil's Atlantic Forest, but only if companies can access finance and technical support to scale up their work. Initiative 20x20 and WRI Brasil are actively working to support efforts like Futuro Florestal's throughout Latin America.<em>Futuro Florestal would like to thank its partners Tropical Flora Reflorestadora, Tropical Eco Wood, and WRI Brasil for their support.",

For one Brazilian company, though, restoring that land makes both ecological and economic sense. Sucupira Agroflorestas grows both trees for timber and crops for food in a vibrant agroforestry system that is reversing that damage. Its goal is to promote agroecological principles as the instruments of a new green revolution.In 2011, the company purchased the first of the 7 rural properties that now make up their 80-hectare farm, Fazenda Sucupira. The initial focus of the farm was growing African mahogany (Khaya spp.) and managing the existing crops better. From experimental plantings, though, the company gained a better understanding of the region\u2019s environmental conditions, allowing the farm to pursue more complex and diversified agroforestry with higher productivity. Today, the farm, evaluated by WRI Brasil and the Verena Project, works with \u201csuccessional agroforestry,\u201d learning how the land naturally regenerates and applying forest ecology principles\u00a0\u2013 and native species\u00a0\u2013 to accelerate restoration and protect biodiversity.There are 63 plant species under cultivation: 29 timber species, 25 fruit trees, 5 spices, and 3 palm trees. More than 60% of these species \u2013 a\u00e7ai, cupua\u00e7u, cocoa, ju\u00e7ara and jabuticaba \u2013 are native to Brazil. The company's forest is home to timber trees at three different ages, which the company selectively harvests and replaces at cycles of 17, 25 and 30 years.To date, Fazenda Sucupria has planted 60 hectares of the property and plans to expand the operation to the entire farm. This involves planting and managing the farm\u2019s Legal Reserve, a part of the property dedicated to native plants that Brazilian law protects. Fazenda Sucupria provides a rich and healthy diet for the people and animals that live or work on the farm.Beyond the positive environmental impacts, Sucupira Agroflorestas\u2019s work has important social benefits. The farm employs a full-time staff of 7 people, almost all of whom are small farmers. The farm is building deeper understanding of the use of native trees in Brazil\u2019s forestry industry, native fruit domestication, and agroforestry management, all nascent fields of research. It partners with research projects and hires student interns from Brazilian universities to train the next generation of aspiring professionals to manage agroforestry projects, hosting 35 students from 10 universities to date.The farm is also investing in agroforestry research by partnering with Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro and Embrapa Agrobiologia. One recent study found that managing projects by copying how nature regenerates, rather than pumping them with herbicides, led to more carbon stored and nutrients in the soil.Sucupira Agroflorestas\u2019s work shows that growing timber and food together is both economically profitable and environmentally beneficial in Brazil. These rare woods and healthy foods fetch a high price on the international market, which helps companies like Sucupira Agroflorestas invest in conserving native species from the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon. The \u201cadded\u201d benefits? They are improving soil richness, conserving water, and sequestering carbon, too. With their ongoing work, Sucupira Agroflorestas is paving the way for the future of agroforestry.",

It spreads across three South American countries (Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay) and provides water and livelihoods for millions of people. The Pantanal is a biodiversity hotspot, home to 4,700 different species, including the largest concentration of crocodiles in the world, jaguars, green anacondas, and the biggest parrot on the planet, the hyacinth macaw. This region is\u00a0called \u201cthe kingdom of the waters\u201d for good reason. It\u2019s one of the most biodiverse landscapes in one of the world\u2019s most biodiverse countries.But the extensive exploitation of the land by unsustainable farming and ranching has resulted in the degradation of much of this vibrant ecosystem. The result? Erosion and sedimentation, overflowing rivers, contaminated water sources, loss of biodiversity, and the modification of natural cycles. As climate change changes weather patterns, severe floods and droughts \u2013 hitting back to back \u2013 have threatened farmers and exacerbated the impact of the fires that people use to clear the land.\u00a0In 2020, The Pantanal experienced its worst fires in more than two decades. The devastated areas include the Fazenda S\u00e3o Francisco do Perigara, a ranch in Mato Grosso, Brazil that has become a key sanctuary for biodiversity.That destruction, though, can be reversed. The Instituto Homem Pantaneiro (IHP), a local NGO, has worked with different public and private players to protect and conserve the water and biodiversity of the Pantanal culture for years now, with the support of Conexi\u00f3n Jaguar, an affiliate of Initiative 20x20 technical partner ISA. The Cabeceiras do Pantanal\u00a0project, led by IHP and Rede do Amolar, aims to protect the springs and preservation areas of the Meseta region of the Upper Paraguay Basin. Together, they are funding the protection of 76,855 hectares of this critical habitat. REDD+ carbon emission reduction certificates are now a new funding source, a recognition of the project's ability to mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity and bring benefits to local communities.Working with a variety of partners, including the Serra do Amolar Protection and Conservation Network and Panthera Colombia, IHP is using these funds to care for the landscape by training local people to conserve the land, prevent and fight fires, and monitor water quality, as well as by creating economic opportunities in sustainable ecotourism and water quality monitoring. The effort employs 19 people, 8 of them women, from local communities.With more funding, ISA, IHP, and partners are hoping to expand the program throughout the biologically important Alto Paraguay basin.",

In 2004, however, Fundaci\u00f3n Patagonica started its important conservation work in the region by purchasing a 69,000-hectare farm known as Estancia Valle Chacabuco, located in Chile's Ays\u00e9n region. This area is a unique transitional ecosystem between the dry Argentinian grasslands to the east of the Andes and the temperate humid forests to the west. The area under conservation has continued to expand with the subsequent acquisition of adjacent lands. Today, Conservacion Patagonica governs 81,000 hectares, and, together with the neighboring Jainemeni and Tamango National Parks, will form the future Patagonia National Park, an unbroken expanse of 292,000 hectares. Conservation Patagonica is restoring this large swath of land for its famous beauty, the promise of ecotourism and the conservation of its native wildlife.Restoration in the Chacabuco Valley involves removal of fences and other barriers to the natural functioning of the ecosystem. This simple action has allowed much of the wildlife to move back to once degraded grasslands. At the same time, volunteers and biologists are assisting the restoration process by removing invasive plants and spreading native seeds throughout the valley. Collaboration among Conservacion Patagonica, the Conservation Land Trust, Fundaci\u00f3n Pumalin, Fundaci\u00f3n Yendegaia and the Foundation for Deep Ecology has promoted the adoption of advanced sustainable agriculture, the development of local communities and a culture of activism that inspires local people and tourists to respect and defend wildlife.Grasslands are ecosystems at risk of degradation around the world. They are often transformed into pasturelands where unsustainable grazing practices take place. Even though these ecosystems are less biodiverse than some tropical ecosystems, they are teeming with wildlife. In the future Patagonia National Park, the recovery of grasslands has led to the return of endemic animals like the guanaco, the culpeo fox, the quirquincho, the condor of the Andes and the puma. This important work has helped to put grassland restoration onto the international restoration agenda through its impressive and ambitious commitment to conserving nature.",

An additional 1,899 ha of private nature reserves have been maintained for protection.Over the entire history of the project 1,160 hectares have been reforested, 461 hectares have been secured through conservation agreements, and 1,899 hectares protected through acquisition. 518,290 trees have been planted as part of this project.The goal of this project is to employ a variety of conservation measures in a mosaic of private lands within two noted focal areas for Cerulean Warbler in Colombia to increase habitat protection for migratory birds, particularly the Cerulean Warbler. The project is focusing on the creation of a nearly 12 km conservation corridor that connects habitat between two ABC established reserves, the Pauxi Pauxi Reserve and the Cerulean Warbler Reserve. ABC is promoting the production of shade coffee, at higher elevations, and shade cacao at lower elevations to improve forest connectivity, wildlife habitat and economic well-being for landowners.Specific activities of the project include:Over 4,000 people were trained through various community activities and informative material delivered during workshops and lectures, whose primary objective was to raise awareness among the community regarding conservation activities, tree nurseries and reforestation, bird identification and the sustainable use of natural resources. A major ongoing activity in the San Vicente municipality is the annual migratory bird festival, which has become a local cultural tradition involving hundreds of participants.In 2014, the project reached an important milestone, planting trees across on 223 farms to span the entire 12 km corridor. Nearly 100 properties have had bird surveys conducted to monitor conservation results.Working with the communities and landowners to support conservation activities, and implement wildlife-friendly agroforestry production, we can help to restore lost habitat for migratory birds in this region of Colombia. It\u2019s important to note that ABC is conducting conservation actions on the Cerulean Warbler's breeding grounds in the US to conserve habitat through the full-annual life cycle of this migratory bird species.ProAves ABC has worked with the Colombian NGO ProAves for many years. ABC has helped ProAves purchase land for preservation, which ProAves now owns and manages. ProAves is our local implementing partner and communicates with landowners, communities, governments and other partner organizations, such as CENICACAO.

Tropical dry forests are\u00a0important carbon sinks, regulate the climate, protect the soil, and store and release water. As part of Initiative 20x20, Colombia has pledged to begin the restoration of 1 million hectares of degraded land, and this threatened natural area is the perfect place to start.\u00a0In response, a consortium led by Fundaci\u00f3n Natura launched the\u00a0Pilot Plan for the Restoration of the Tropical Dry Forest in Colombia's Huila Department, the country's largest restoration project to date.

One of the\u00a0highest rates of plant diversity in the northern Amazon can be found within the park\u2019s lowland rainforest, while its\u00a0tepuys\u00a0contain plant species endemic to the savannas of the Guianas.The Andes Amazon Fund, an Initiative 20x20 financial partner, has invested nearly US$ 2\u00a0million to expand Chiribiquete by 1.5 million hectares, along with its partners the Bobolink Foundation, Fundaci\u00f3n para la Conservaci\u00f3n y el Desarrollo Sostenible (FCDS),\u00a0and the Wyss Foundation. With this investment in July 2018,\u00a0Colombia was able to expand the park, first declared in 1989, to protect\u00a0more than\u00a04.3\u00a0million hectares of Amazonian rainforest in southern Colombia. Chiribiquete is now the world's largest tropical rainforest national park.\u00a0The donation will contribute to\u00a0Herencia Colombia\u00a0(Heritage Colombia) \u2013\u00a0a government-led financing initiative that aims to strengthen the management of the country\u2019s protected areas \u2013\u00a0and will be administered by the Colombian National Park Service. The government will now be able to\u00a0better monitor and manage this critically important pristine ecosystem.Chiribiquete's dense forests store carbon, helping Colombia fight climate change, and\u00a0safeguard critical water resources.\u00a0The park\u00a0also protects the livelihoods\u00a0of local people.\u00a0The rivers found within Chiribiquete\u00a0serve as an important spawning ground for fish that later return to the Caquet\u00e1 River. Many local\u00a0communities that live nearby depend on these fish stocks for their main source of protein. As a result, the protection of the park\u2019s rivers will help\u00a0ensure the food security<b>\u00a0</b>of local people. The\u00a0<i>tepuys</i> and other sites scattered through the park are sacred to local indigenous people, and the expansion of the park will protect impressive cultural diversity. The ancient cave paintings found in Chiribiquete, some dating to as early as 450 CE, attracted the attention of UNESCO, which declared the park a World Heritage Site.This expansion is particularly critical now, as deforestation is mounting in the areas to the north and west of Chiribiquete. Providing this extra level of protection to the intact wilderness around the core of the park will prevent its destruction as the surrounding forest is rapidly cleared by land grabbers.\u00a0Avoiding deforestation is also a crucial first step toward reaching\u00a0Latin America\u2019s ambitious\u00a0landscape restoration goals under Initiative 20x20. Chiribiquete\u2019s expansion stops degradation in this ecologically sensitive area and avoids the future cost of restoration. For Colombia,\u00a0a country that has recently suffered from devastating deforestation, Chiribiquete's expansion represents a step in the right direction.",

Initiative 20x20 partner 12Tree is now rehabilitating 400 hectares of cocoa plantations in La Jagua de Ibirico. Hacienda Maquencal is a large farm in the Cesar department, spanning 947 hectares, 200 of which are protected natural and old-growth secondary forest.After decades of instability, Maquencal provides a well-paid and sustainable source of employment in this recovering region. As part of its commitment to its employees, 12Tree raised wages and provides healthcare, pensions, professional development and safety training and education for the farm's 206 employees and their families.12Tree has made the farm climate-smart by composting cocoa pods that would otherwise go to waste to use as soil-improving organic fertilizer. To improve efficiency, they are revamping the watering system with the latest and most efficient drip irrigation technology and constructing a reservoir that will provide the farm with sufficient water even during the severe droughts that will occur more frequently as the climate changes. The farm is also collecting data to more effectively manage the amount of water and nutrients that its crops require. Through this monitoring program, Hacienda Maquencal is using less fertilizer and water while producing the same amount of cocoa.12Tree has also built a state-of-the-art post-harvesting center that preserves and processes the cocoa to extend its shelf life. The facility will ultimately allow for a faster and more even fermentation and drying process, substantially improving the quality of the cocoa and increasing its attractiveness to international buyers. In the coming years, the company aims to expand its production by working with local small farmers in its outgrower network and obtaining UTZ certification.",

With no trees left, timber companies fled the country's Guanacaste region, taking jobs and economic opportunity with them. Now, after decades of planting trees to restore land, Initiative 20x20 partner Forestry and Climate Change Fund (FCCF) is working with local entrepreneur Nestor Baltodano and his two companies to sustainably manage 400 hectares of new secondary forests and create a thriving rural wood products economy.To ensure that the supply of wood products continues for decades, Operaciones Forestales Sostenibles (OFS), one of Baltodano's companies, provides the necessary expertise to conserve the region's secondary forests. OFS works with local landowners by helping them sustainably manage, harvest, and sell their trees, lightening the burden on farmers by marketing their products for them. By sharing their profit with landowners, OFS has also built trust with local leaders.As part of its mission, the company is also protecting and restoring trees around the Guanacaste Dry Forest Conservation Area, home to 2.4% of the world\u2019s total terrestrial biodiversity. By managing the land well, OFS is also reducing risk from forest fires, which are common in dry forests, and protecting local communities.Now that OFS has acquired the timber from landowners, what happens next? Here is where BluWood, Baltodano's other company, comes in.BluWood takes that timber and produces solid and engineered wood flooring, decking and other high-end products for local and export markets for local and international markets, employing people living in nearby communities and building a rural manufacturing economy in Guanacaste. The company is currently exploring where it can expand to sell its legally and sustainably sourced wood. Buyers have a fully traceable supply chain, and local people benefit.By working together, OFS and BluWood have pioneered a fair sourcing policy that ensures that forest owners receive an adequate price for their timber.\u00a0The companies have larger ambitions, too. They plan to expand their own operations to 4,000 hectares in the next two to three years are also hoping to host other wood products companies in their underused facility to nurture this nascent industry. By keeping all stages of production from tree planting to finished products in the region, the two companies are creating a restoration economy that boosts incomes in this struggling region and harnesses the economic value of forests without destroying them.",

This integated agroforestry system will be the largest organic cocoa plantation in the Dominican Republic and among the largest in the world, employing 500 people. The farm is split between a mechanized production area, a non-mechanized production area and protected natural forests. A modern fertigation process, which injects fertilizers into the irrigation system, will be installed in the mechanized area to minimize fertilizer use and maximize production. In parallel, new and higher-yielding coconut palms will be planted next to the existing older palms. The older coconut palms will continue to produce nuts until the new palms start producing. The entire project will be certified organic and will produce premium cocoa for export, as well as a range of premium coconut products, such as virgin coconut oil, coconut water, and sugar, to be sold domestically and abroad. Central to 12Tree's business model and sustainability approach is the preservation of nearby natural forests. By conserving 843 hectares, 12Tree can rely on the important ecosystem services, like natural pest control, wind protection, and water flow regulation, that boost production in the cultivated areas of the farm \u2013 at absolutely no cost.

        "descriptions": "Ecuador occupies 0.2% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial surface and has some of the highest rates of endemism in the world. It also contains the fourth highest number of bird species of any country in the world. Due to monoculture plantations (palm oil, bananas, cacao and teak wood), logging, extensive cattle grazing and a prolific shrimp industry, the entire country has undergone massive deforestation. This rapid extraction of resources has placed many native and migratory bird species at risk, and in some cases at the brink of extinction. The American Bird Conservancy(ABC) and Fundaci\u00f3n Jocotoco have partnered to purchase and restore some of the most important remaining tracts of intact habitat for priority bird species in Ecuador. ABC is assisting with tourism development to make these reserves sustainable.From 2014 to the present, ABC has assisted Fundaci\u00f3n Jocotoco in expanding six of its 11 private reserves (Antisana, Canand\u00e9, Narupa, Tapichalaca, and Buenaventura Reserves) by acquiring 3,720 ha.In northern Ecuador, the acquisition of 47 ha to expand the Narupa Reserve has preserved valuable wintering habitat for Cerulean Warblers, a migratory bird species. Both the Cerulean's breeding and wintering habitat are being lost; its population has declined by about 70 percent in the past 40 years, making it one of North America's most threatened migratory songbirds. The eastern slope of the Andes, where Narupa Reserve lies, is one of the most important wintering areas for the species in Ecuador. ABC has also supported Fundaci\u00f3n Jocotoco in the management of Narupa, which includes hiring additional park guards and training them to not only patrol the land to limit incursions but also manage the land to allow natural regeneration of secondary forest habitat, which Cerulean Warblers prefer.In southern Ecuador, an additional 136 hectares were acquired since 2014 to expand the Buenaventura Reserve. These acquisitions protect some of the only remaining habitat for the rare and endangered El Oro Parakeet and the El Oro Tapaculo. At the Buenaventura Reserve ABC has also contributed significantly to the development of infrastructure for bird tourism (lodge cabins, hummingbird garden, and trail maintenance) to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of this protected area. ABC has also funded reforestation projects (8,363 native trees planted) and migratory bird monitoring in restored tracts. Through environmental education workshops with community stakeholders, ABC and Jocotoco have conveyed the importance of watershed protection, using native trees for ecosystem services and convincing local government officials to quit using invasive species (pine and eucalyptus) for restoration projects.Our business model for this conservation project is to sustain these reserves trough the development of bird tourism. ABC\u2019s Conservation Birding initiative encourages birders and nature travelers to \u201csee it, save it\u201d by visiting reserves in our Latin American Bird Reserve Network, using tourism income to support ongoing reserve management costs. In Ecuador, ABC has provided resources to improve marketing, promotion and lodging facilities at Tapichalaca, Narupa, and Buenaventura Reserves. Financial sustainability is critical for ensuring long-term protection of these reserves which are critical for species like the Jocotco Antpitta, an AZE (Alliance for Zero Extinction) species, a species of bird that can be found nowhere else in the world.ABC works with Fundaci\u00f3n Jocotoco, an Ecuadorian nongovernmental organization established in 1998 to protect land of critical importance to the conservation of Ecuador's endangered birds and associated biodiversity. Jocotoco primarily achieves this by purchasing lands, restoring degraded areas and managing them as ecological reserves. Southern Wings has provided important funding for part of the restoration.",

        "descriptions": "In 2008, Ecuador had over 9.5 million hectares of native forests, but was losing thousands of hectares every year to deforestation. To protect a major linchpin of its economy and to preserve the critical ecosystem services that its forests provide, the Government of Ecuador decided to act. The Socio Bosque Program, a voluntary incentive-based scheme with combined environmental and socioeconomic targets, was its response. It hopes to protect 4 million hectares, nearly 16% of Ecuador's total land mass, and help between 500,000 and 1 million people.Through conservation agreements, Socio Bosque offers the poorest private and communal forest landowners annual payments for each hectare of forest cover maintained. Landowners receive $60 for every hectare protected between one and 20 hectares and $30 between 20 and 50 hectares. For each additional higher hectare category, landowners receive less money per hectare for maintaining forest cover, ensuring that smallholders benefit the most. The program also requires recipients to come up with an alternative sustainable management plan, helping farmers and herders envision how they could use their land productively while still preserving forest cover. Payments are conditional on compliance, and the government actively monitors individual progress though using satellite imagery.The program was explicitly designed to support the poorest rural landowners and communities in Ecuador, and they have flocked to it.\u00a0Socio Bosque has invested $61 million since 2008 to conserve forests throughout the country, protecting over 1.5 million hectares of its 4-million-hectare goal by 2016 through 2,800 20-year agreements with private landowners and communities. It has had a marked impact on annual net deforestation in Ecaudor, which has declined from 77,000 to 44,000 hectares. This significant avoided deforestation has also lowered Ecuador's greenhouse gas emissions, helping it meet its Paris Agreement pledge.The program does require applicants to have legal title to their land, which many rural communities in Ecuador still lack. But the government and its partners have dedicated themselves to making progress on this critical step needed to expand Socio Bosque. The government continues to see itself as the main funding provider for the program but has explored other funding options like REDD+ payments, new green taxes, and soliciting corporate donations.",

This area is part of the Huancabamba Depression of the Andes and\u00a0includes numerous smaller ranges and basins, as well as\u00a0a dense system of rivers that drain into the Amazon. Due to the relatively low height of the mountains, the Huancabamba Depression serves as a transition zone from the tropical moist northern to the drier central Andes, as well as from the drier lowlands of the Pacific coast to the humid Amazon lowlands in the east. This makes the proposed 444,592-hectare Zamora Chinchipe Provincial Reserve an important biodiversity hotspot that supports critical ecosystem services. The reserve is supported by Andes Amazon Fund, an Initiative 20x20 financial partner, and Nature and Culture International (NCI), Zamora Chinchipe is the third provincial reserve in Ecuador, after Carchi and Pastaza, establishing permanent protection for an area previously devastated by deforestation. The province loses approximately 29,400 acres per year to deforestation, the second highest rate in Ecuador. The forests and p\u00e1ramo grasslands of Zamora Chinchipe Province are home to numerous endemic and endangered bird species such as the red-faced parrot and the masked mountain-tanager; endemic rodents including Kalinowski\u2019s old field mouse and the Inca old field mouse; and flagship species such as the mountain tapir, the spectacled bear and the endangered white-bellied spider monkey. Likewise, the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor along the Peru-Ecuador border, part of which falls within the proposed reserve, has extremely diverse plant life. It may have the richest flora of any similar-sized area in the Americas, and it has one of the highest concentrations of vascular plant species still unknown to science of any place on Earth. The drinking water for the nine municipalities within Zamora Chinchipe is provided by the rivers and streams whose sources lie in the forests and p\u00e1ramo grasslands that will be protected within the reserve. The humidity and water used for irrigation is also provided by the natural ecosystems that lie within the proposed reserve. The approximately 91,000 people living in Zamora Chinchipe depend directly on the ecosystem services that are generated within the proposed reserve. 15 percent of the population is indigenous, principally members of the Shuar Nation. These communities have preserved and used natural forests sustainably for centuries, with their own production systems and ancestral practices. These traditional practices continue to this day in areas like the Shuar territories of the Yacuambi and Nangaritza river basins, some of the last remnants of untouched forest between the Andes and the Amazon in Ecuador. Local people support themselves mainly through subsistence agriculture, cocoa, coffee and sugarcane production, and raising livestock in the valleys. With the support of Andes Amazon Fund and NCI, this way of life can continue in this ecologically important area.",

Located in the province of Morona Santiago, this area increases connectivity between Sangay National Park, Pastaza Provincial Reserve, and R\u00edo Upano Municipal Conservation Area and is part of\u00a0a network of protected areas spanning\u00a0over 3 million hectares. In recent years, the municipality of Huamboya has been under increasing deforestation pressure due to agricultural development. The new municipal conservation area will reduce this threat.The municipal government is partnering with civil society organizations, indigenous peoples, and other local communities to protect this vital, biodiverse watershed. Comprised of eight areas between\u00a02,000 and\u00a05,600 feet above sea level, Huamboya fills an altitude gap in the country\u2019s national protected area system. This is critical for the preservation of species such as the\u00a0vulnerable spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). The area has also been identified as an\u00a0Endemic Bird Area with an estimated 36 range-restricted species. These include the Ecuadorian piedtail (<em>Phlogophilus hemileucurus</em>), coppery-chested jacamar (<em>Galbula pastazae</em>), and napo sabrewing (<em>Campylopterus villaviscensio</em>). Scientists estimate that Huamboya contains a high level of plant endemism, as 20 percent\u00a0of Ecuador\u2019s total endemic plant species can be found in the nearby and ecologically-similar area of Sangay National Park.\u00a0Huamboya will also safeguard important water resources for local communities and will help preserve the cultural traditions of the indigenous Shuar Nation.

Across 638 hectares of land, including 407 ha of cocoa and 119 ha of teak, the fertile soils and the favorable microclimate of this region are key to the high cocoa yields that Rio Lindo is known for.The farms uses a model that employs a special nutrient mix, intensive pruning, efficient soil management, and ongoing maintenance of the cocoa trees to increase the lifespan of the trees and quality of the crop. Efficient fertigation providing the right amount of fertilizer through an efficient irrigation system is the cornerstone of this high productivity, along with mechanized pruning and harvesting. 12Tree\u2019s sustainability principles will be applied to increase ecological and social impact, raising the farms\u2019 overall value by delivering sustainably sourced cocoa. As part of that plan, the company is revamping the waste management system to maximize recycling and is planting trees that restore nitrogen to the soil. To boost biodiversity, native species and fruit trees are planted throughout the farm. Because of its commitment to fair wages and excellent working conditions, 12Tree is also conducting a survey that explores how it can better understand the needs of its 118 workers.Rio Lindo's cocoa is currently being sold wet in the local market, but 12Tree aims to expand internationally. That means producing and selling dry beans efficiently and with the quality that buyers require. To achieve that goal, the company is constructing a state-of-the-art post-harvesting center and has received UTZ certification for Rio Lindo.

Over the past decade 65% of the original forest cover has been lost in this region, long under the pressures of deforestation and unsustainable land use. ABC and our partner FUNDAECO are working to protected the remaining blocks of forest and are working to develop agroforestry programs in the buffer zones of the protected areas to provide further habitat for migratory birds.Its variety of ecosystems has made the Conservation Coast one of the Guatemalas\u2019s biodiversity hotspots, harboring almost 50% of the country\u2019s biodiversity, including 57 species of amphibians (including multiple AZE species), 89 reptiles, and 471 bird species, of which over 100 are migratory. Due to its extremely high biological value for birds and biodiversity, ABC has been working in this region over the past five years with local partner Foundation for Eco-Development and Conservation (FUNDAECO) in the creation and management of a regional network of protected areas. ABC has assisted with the acquisition of multiple properties protecting over 3,360 hectares at key sites for migratory birds. Since 2014 ABC has helped FUNDACO purchase and protect 2,354 of these hectares with the support of Southern Wings. Together we are now expanding from our \u201cprotected area\u201d conservation strategy to a \u201clandscape\u201d strategy to work with farmers and producers of various products to increase forest cover in and around protected areas within the birdscape.To address the drivers of forest loss and promote restoration of forest cover, we are establishing an agroforestry program with local landowners that produce wildlife-friendly crops and products, such as black pepper, cardamom, rubber, cacao, and mahogany along the Conservation Coast. Initial financial analysis of these products are promising. Over the next 10 to 15 years we aim to positively impact as many as 40,000 ha through successful implementation of agroforestry production systems.Our strategy will include an investment program to direct funding to production methods that improve land use and habitat conditions and produce financial returns for landowners and investors.Big and small landowners require different support to create the desired ecological and financial changes. ABC and FUNDAECO will identify and implement solutions for working with landowners of different size classes. Part of our program will include the development of BioCenters, which will act as training grounds for other landowners as they will be demonstration sites for the use of different methods production of different crops. Additionally, we are currently monitoring agroforestry models that use native species for their benefits to birds and financial outputs.The results of this work will lead to an improvement in the protection of forest blocks through decreased pressure on the land, increased habitat availability for birds through agroforestry implementation, boosted carbon sequestration and improved livelihoods for local landowners.",

The investment aims to avoid over 8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions through avoided deforestation, an increase of 3.8 million ha from its initial target. The investment also enables the restoration of over 1,000 hectares of degraded land situated in buffer zones around the protected areas, bolstering conservation efforts in the process. A diverse variety of agricultural produce including cardamom, xate, pepper, rambutan, lychee, cinnamon and timber will be produced with agroforestry systems,  improving the livelihoods of small scale farmers and their families, ensuring a transition towards sustainable land use in and around the protected areas. This will all be accomplished in partnership with local communities who suffer the most from forest loss and degradation. The remaining forests of the Guatemalan Caribbean are highly important for biodiversity conservation because they are an important migratory corridor. Over 120 species of migratory birds use the Caribbean forests as wintering or stop over sites. The forests of the Caribbean Region also provide key environmental services for local towns and communities, including drinking water, protection against the sedimentation of port navigation channels, reduction of risks of natural disasters, timber, and a variety of non-timber forest products. At the landscape level, the Caribbean Region provides a unique opportunity for tourism, with its unique natural and cultural heritage. These forests are also highly threatened due to deforestation and unsustainable land uses activities, mainly slash and burn agriculture and extensive cattle ranching. Althelia\u2019s investment will finance the establishment of new nature reserves and protected areas that also address the needs of the local human population to safeguard the highest risk forest areas. In addition, it will provide resources to manage and scientifically monitor the existing protected areas and surrounding buffer areas, which have historically been under-resourced and vulnerable to illegal exploitation. A new sustainable development paradigm will be catalyzed through investing in over 1,000 ha of agroforestry systems, which will provide new revenue streams and opportunities for local landowners and communities. This will be coupled with an injection of capital into the region's eco-tourism network to open new sites, improve existing ones and improve marketing. This will create sustainable jobs whilst allowing more people to experience the unique beauty of the region's forests, rivers and the Caribbean Sea. The implementation partner of this project is Fundacion para el Ecodesarrollo y la Conservacion (FUNDAECO), a leading Guatemalan NGO, which has over 25 years of experience in conservation and sustainable community development. This project is also being done in close coordination with government agencies, and social and community organizations. FUNDAECO coordinates closely with the National Council of Protected Areas (CONAP), the governmental agency in charge of protected areas in Guatemala, with whom FUNDAECO has signed agreements for protected area co-management.",

Outside of the Reserve, most of the existing forests have already suffered severe degradation and today\u00a0offer little value to their owners.To revitalize the land, halt deforestation, and create new sources of sustainable income, FCCF has developed a partnership with Fundaci\u00f3n Naturaleza para la Vida (NPV), a Guatemalan foundation established in 1997. NPV's work helps local communities\u00a0conserve their forests and manage them successfully.\u00a0NPV primarily supports projects in the\u00a0multiple land-use zone of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. By working with\u00a0local communities, private landowners, grassroots organizations and public and private institutions, these concessions are managed sustainably in accordance with the law and to strict Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards.\u00a0Starting small with an area of around\u00a0600 ha,\u00a0the venture hopes to scale up and help more local land landowners,\u00a0under the supervision of NPV, to produce high-quality forest and wood products for the market.The project benefits rural families and landowners living in Pet\u00e9n, people who have a strong emotional relationship to the forests\u00a0like\u00a0Don El\u00edas Calder\u00f3n, who manages a\u00a0forest area of 114 ha in Western\u00a0Pet\u00e9n.\u00a0By providing an economic alternative to clearcutting and the\u00a0overexploitation of\u00a0forest resources, the project helps to avoid the ongoing expansion of palm oil production\u00a0and commodity agriculture in this vibrant forest ecosystem\u00a0and contributes to the preservation of local community identities\u00a0and livelihoods. The investment will also create jobs in forest management and wood processing for local people, incentivizing young people to stay in their communities instead of migrating to cities or other countries. The sustainable management of Pet\u00e9n's forests also will help Guatemala meet its climate goals: sustainably managed forests sequester carbon. By investing in Guatemala's\u00a0forests, FCCF and NPV are investing in the country's\u00a0future.",

Since 2017, the company has restored around 400\u00a0hectares\u00a0of degraded farmland on the northeastern coast of Guyana, a country\u00a0historically known for high-quality agricultural\u00a0products.Central to Pomeroon's success is Climate Smart Agriculture,\u00a0building a more resilient food system that produces more but pollutes less. Pomeroon, an Initiative 20x20 financial partner, prides itself on being a climate-sensitive enterprise.\u00a0Facilities on the firm's Stoll Estate run on solar power, and\u00a0Pomeroon has invested in natural mangrove and man-made flood defenses to adapt to sea-level rise and severe weather.\u00a0The company never cuts down trees to expand its plantations and will soon seek\u00a0Rainforest Alliance certification.\u00a0Instead, it restores coconut trees to degraded land to meet rising demand. Pomeroon's 65,000 new trees\u00a0will sequester up to 2,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent\u00a0per year.Pomeroon is an enterprise with a strong interest in the vitality of local communities.\u00a0The company, which directly employs over 50 local people, has also constructed\u00a0one of the Caribbean\u2019s largest private coconut seedling nurseries to increase its overall productivity and accelerate its restoration work. The local smallholder coconut\u00a0producers who work with Pomeroon can also access and use the nursery\u00a0through a cooperative program. The company has also sponsored upgrades to two\u00a0local primary schools and\u00a0a women's empowerment seminar.After decades of degradation, Pomeroon knew that only biodiversity could restore the land to its former productivity.\u00a0The firm's\u00a0cutting-edge\u00a0intercropping program\u00a0mixes several other crops, from bananas to turmeric, moringa to passionfruit,\u00a0with its coconut trees. Intercropping not only provides diversified sources of revenue but is good agronomy: It combats surface erosion and improves soil fertility. Restoration is a key aspect of Pomeroon's economic success.The company is now investing in processing facilities that can produce\u00a0coconut water, coconut by-products, and spices, tapping into a coconut\u00a0market that is growing 10% annually. The coconut water market alone could be worth $8.3 billion by 2023. To meet that demand, Pomeroon is becoming a publicly listed company on the Guyana Stock Exchange in 2020, becoming the country's first public agribusiness.Its\u00a0river-front location also makes Pomeroon\u00a0well-positioned to access export markets, including the growing North American coconut water market\u00a0and other Caribbean-focused markets.\u00a0By adding value to its raw products, Pomeroon is createing an ecologically and economically\u00a0sustainable\u00a0business model that restores degraded land and turns a profit.",

        "descriptions": "The Chihuahuan Desert of northern Mexico is a continentally important wintering area for grassland birds \u2013 the most rapidly declining group of birds in North America. More than 90% of migratory grassland bird species breeding in western North America spend at least half their life cycle concentrated in the limited grasslands of the Chihuahuan Desert region. Initiative 20x20 partner\u00a0American Bird Conservancy's\u00a0project is designed to work with ranchers within the Valles Centrales Grassland Priority Conservation Area in Chihuahua state to improve ranching practices that improve forage production for cattle, which simultaneously increases habitat for grassland birds.Between 2006 and 2010, cropland in the Valles Centrales increased by 69%, destroying 2,452 km2 of grasslands and displacing an estimated 1,000,000 grassland birds. The expansion of agriculture in Chihuahua is leading to the\u00a0loss of native grasslands. Drought, climate change, and inappropriate ranching practices have pinched ranchers financially, forcing them to sell off their properties to farmers. However, with the deployment of additional infrastructure and rotational cycles, the degraded grasslands can be restored. This improvement is a benefit to ranchers and birds, and also helps sequester carbon. The program's goal is to improve the management of 100,000 ha of Chihuahua Desert Grasslands across northern Mexico.ABC's approach includes deploying Private Lands Specialists to engage landowners in the Valles Centrales and provide technical support and services for the implementation of grassland conservation projects on private and communal lands. These specialists conduct outreach to raise awareness and interest in grassland birds and their habitat needs\u00a0and work directly with landowners to engage them in on-the-ground restoration projects on their land. Conservation agreements are established between interested landowners and project partner\u00a0Pronatura Noreste, which has helped\u00a0to design, implement and finance this project.These agreements facilitate communication with the landowners, and lead to the development of ranch management plans. Through the establishment of a habitat conservation fund, ABC and PNE make funding available to the ranchers for the implementation of the new ranch plans and installation of infrastructure such as fencing and water tanks. The habitat fund also leverages additional resources from Mexican federal assistance programs and other grant programs.Through the review of ranch conditions and herd management programs, additional paddocks are installed and a rotational grazing program set forth. Doing so facilitates high intensity grazing for short periods of time in smaller areas. Cattle hooves help break up the soil, allowing improved moisture infiltration to the soil. (Mechanical soil aeration may be necessary.) Additionally, each paddock has a longer rest period, allowing for longer restoration period. Together, these actions help restore grasslands. This can provide better habitat for biodiversity, particularly migratory birds, and provide economic benefit for landowners. Monitoring programs are underway at the moment to measure these benefits.Most ranchers in Valles Centrales are calf-cow operations that focus on the production of calves, which are then sold for fattening up. ABC's\u00a0model is to work with the landowners to evaluate their current management, develop a new rotational grazing plan, and cost-share the funding for the requisite infrastructure. The financial benefits go to the landowner. Additional investment of infrastructure financing could be worked into an investment model that provides return on investment through calf sales.To date, ABC and Pronatura Noreste\u00a0work with 5 landowners on nearly 30,000 ha, and have identified 3 additional landowners, who manage another nearly 30,000 ha. They began to work on restoration with them in 2017 and 2018.Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, and IMC Vida Silvestre are assisting with biodiversity monitoring. The National Audubon Society is involved in promoting improved grassland management and are investigating the animal custody chain within the beef industry. And Initiative 20x20 partner\u00a0Pasticultores del Desierto is another partner that is bringing in additional landowners and financing to implement improved grassland management. This innovative partnership will help revitalize thousands of hectares of degraded land throughout one of Mexico's most unique ecosystems.",

This large pledge is in addition to Mexico's nearly 7.5-million-hectare commitment to the Bonn Challenge and Initiative 20x20. Four years later, CONAFOR has met its goal.To accomplish such an ambitious undertaking, CONAFOR incentivized activities that help communities and landowners living in priority watersheds and on lands with heavily degraded soils that have suffered from forest cover loss or have been ravaged by forest fires, pests or other natural disasters. CONAFOR spent roughly 12 billion pesos (approximately US$ 591 million).The program has so far performed well: Plant survival increased from 33% in 2014 to 64% in 2018, a feat that was verified by the Universidad de Chapingo, an independent third party. Also, CONAFOR has strengthened the program by formulating norms for the collection and reproduction of tree species. This has increased plant quality, a key factor to making a large-scale restoration effort a success.CONAFOR also provides technical assistance and delivers periodical financial support to enable landowners and communities to implement restoration projects. Without this valuable guidance from the forest authority, communities would not have had access to critical technical know-how.While the program has already exceeded its goal, it is still active. CONAFOR's large-scale restoration project has encouraged and will continue to advise Mexicans to plant trees for the economic health of rural communities, to provide crucial ecosystem services, and to help make Mexico resilient to climate change.",

To boost the industry, which produces\u00a0tape, chewing gum and hundreds of other products,\u00a0Ejido Verde and its partners realized that indigenous people are the best stewards of their own land, and they set out to financially enable them.The company has a triple-bottom-line approach: Economically, it helps indigenous farmers tap into the US$10 billion global pine chemicals market and guarantees a fair market price for all resin tapped.\u00a0Socially, it raises living standards in Michoac\u00e1n by providing new opportunities for young people to both restore degraded land and learn about sustainable business models. Ejido Verde also trains and educates resin-producers\u00a0to strengthen effective community decision-making and forestry management practices.\u00a0Environmentally, it relies on the restoration of severely\u00a0deforested land as the central pillar of its business model. Without planting native pine trees, there is no Ejido Verde.\u00a0The company\u2019s founding investors have a long-term vision. The native trees produce\u00a0resin\u00a08 to\u00a010 years after planting, but continue to produce for up to 80 years. Ejido Verde also employs innovative financing structures to ensure that farmers can afford the upfront costs of tree planting and maintenance. To scale up its financing model, Ejido Verde has partnered with Kiva, a crowdsourcing platform that allows small investors to loan as little as US$25 to growing entrepreneurs.When the trees start to produce resin, the farmers will pay back the lenders on Kiva, allowing the money to be reused again.\u00a0Several indigenous farmers have raised thousands of dollars, which they have used to both restore land and provide for their families. Farmers pay back lenders with 10% of their annual resin sales.\u00a0So far,\u00a0thousands of investors from 66 countries have helped Ejido Verde provide 11\u00a0communities with zero-interest loans to plant and maintain new forests.Ejido Verde sets farmers up for success through its strong emphasis on good forestry. 800 trees are planted on each hectare, and in 8-10 years each farmer can earn $4.40 from the resin that each tree produces. That's $3,500 per hectare per year.\u00a0If Ejido Verde reaches its goal of reforesting 12,000 hectares by 2022, it could bring $1 billion of new revenue to indigenous smallholder farmers and create over 6,000 full-time jobs. Farmers who participate in the company's program can make $18,000 per year, over double the current annual income in the region.The environmental benefits are substantial as well. Restoring thousands of hectares of native trees can raise water tables, prevent erosion, provide habitat for other plants and animals, and cool the landscape. Planting almost 10 million trees could also suck 6 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\u00a0By creating a business model with restoration at its core, Ejido Verde puts local people first and supports the long-term economic, social, and environmental health of Michoac\u00e1n's\u00a0Purh\u00e9pecha\u00a0communities.",

After completing their mammoth journey, the monarchs arrive in the hills of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, where they settle down for a few months to rest and breed in the 56,000 hectares of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The livelihood of the monarch depends on the oyamel or sacred fir tree (Abies religiosa) that grows there. The butterflies spend December to March each year clinging to these trees that protect them from the rain and the chill. But deforestation throughout Michoac\u00e1n over the past decades has fragmented the habitat of this iconic species.Without realizing their immense ecological value, people have illegally harvested oyamel trees for woodfuel and timber. At the same time, a major forest fire in 1978, followed by severe seasonal rains, washed away fertile soil. The result is that hundreds of thousands of tree seedlings, planted in an effort to restore this area in the past 30 years, have died. And the area is not naturally regenerating quickly enough to fully restore the landscape, partially because climate change is increasing temperatures in the reserve, shrinking the area where the oyamel can grow.The disappearance of the oyamel forest is not only affecting the monarch butterfly, whose population has decreased by 80% in just 20 years, but also the local communities that own the forest and rely on it for their livelihoods, water, healthy soil, and erosion control.In 2016, Initiative 20x20 partner Land Life Company began to reforest over 100 hectares of degraded land in the Reserve, restoring the monarch's habitat together with Mexico's National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) and its National Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP), local communities, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The project, along with others throughout the Reserve that have planted more than 4 million trees, has helped stabilize soil, cool the surrounding area, and bring streams spring back to life.The local communities are taking action and have begun a 24-hour surveillance program to stop illegal logging, but still lack the funds or technical knowledge to restore the degraded land surrounding their homes. In the near future, Land Life Company and its partners hope to close this gap and plant more trees in this critically important and biodiverse ecosystem.",

Decades of mismanagement after the lake entirely disappeared have severely degraded the land, leaving it largely an unproductive dust bowl.During the rainy season, flash floods rush across the basin, putting lives in danger. And in the dry season, dirt and dust blows across the basin. On top of that, temperatures widely fluctuate because of the lack of tree cover.Trees are the perfect solution to these problems: They hold soil in place, keep water in the soil, provide a home to unique plants and animals, and regulate the climate. But because of the challenging environment, all reforestation efforts at the site have failed. Over the past fifty years, millions of trees have been planted in Lake Texcoco, but only 2% have survived.Initiative 20x20 partner Land Life Company (LLC) was offered the chance to collaborate with Mexico's National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) to try out an innovative solution\u00a0to plant and help trees survive for decades. Across 160 hectares, the company's cocoons, which protect saplings by surrounding them with a biodegradable shell, went into the ground in September 2015. The cocoons provide just enough water and nutrients to keep the tree alive, but not so much that that tree becomes dependent on the inputs. Only 16 months after planting, the trees were growing well, and 85-90% survived, without any irrigation. The trees had all reached two meters high with deep root systems, despite the poor soil, thanks to the cocoons.Three years into the project, 80% of the Cupressus, Casuarina and Tamarix trees that LLC has planted have survived, and as of April 2019, some are already over eight meters tall. The young forest is beginning to develop a vibrant ecosystem of animals and plants, creating clean air and a healthy, green future for generations to come.",

It\u2019s not just popular for barbecue; mesquite wood is used in furniture, medicinal teas and fodder.A substantial share of the world\u2019s mesquite comes from Baja California in the northwest of Mexico, where the trees grew abundantly across the state. But unsustainable harvesting practices have led to the large-scale deforestation of this once lush region. Now, large areas of Baja California are deserted because the soil is degraded and low rainfall and hot summer temperatures make life difficult.Restoring that land by planting mesquite trees is a way to both revitalize the environment and provide economic opportunities for local farming communities struggling to get by. Together with the Ejido Carmen Serda\u0301n community and Mexico's National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), Initiative 20x20 partner Land Life Company is planting a sustainable mesquite tree plantation on formerly unused and degraded communal ejido farmland.To prepare the land for restoration, the company used a ripper to break the compacted topsoil and built a dam to irrigate the trees. By the end of the project, local people will have planted 25,000 mesquite trees across 130 hectares.The company's secret to ensuring that the mesquite trees can survive in even the harshest environments is its cocoon, which protects saplings by surrounding them with a biodegradable shell. The cocoons provide just enough water and nutrients to keep the tree alive, but not so much that that tree becomes dependent on the inputs.The mesquite trees help restore the land while providing a sustainable source of income, cattle fodder, and honey for the 300 people that depend on this land for their welfare, and the environmental services that they supply support a further 600 people who live in nearby communities.Biodiversity matters for the company, too. To encourage other plants and animals to return to the landscape, other tree species were planted with the mesquite seedlings. The progress of the project will be measured closely and a fence will be built to protect the trees from roaming cattle.Carmen Serda\u0301n will be one of the first commercial mesquite plantations on communal <em>ejido </em>land in Mexico, supplying mesquite charcoal to barbecue-loving consumers in the US. This project could show the path forward to restoring the tens of thousands of hectares of degraded land in Baja California, while improving the economic situation of rural communities.",

In particular, this area is important for the golden-winged warbler and has a density approximately twice as high as at any other site surveyed as part of the 7-country NFWF Golden-winged Warbler project. The golden-winged warbler (GWWA) is a migratory bird species that has experienced once of the most rapid population declines among all migratory birds in the Western Hemisphere, a loss of nearly 40% since 1960. The American Bird Conservancy (ABC) helped to develop the wintering ground conservation plan for this species and has been working to conserve the warbler since 2007.In Nicaragua, ABC has worked with the Red de Reservas Silvestres Privadas and their member landowners, in particular in the El Jaguar Reserve. Other organizations that have been involved in the project include Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), Audubon North Carolina, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, and El Centro de Entendimiento con la Naturaleza (CEN).Land use conversion from primary forest to agriculture, including sun coffee and potatoes, is reducing habitat available for migratory bird species in the Jinotega region, including the GWWA, and reduces the number of individuals that the area can support due to decreased food and cover. Logging and cattle production further limit wildlife habitat.ABC is working to protect existing forest and increase forest connectivity in this region through the promotion of reforestation with native species for fence rows, and water source protection and to encourage shade-coffee production. ABC has worked with over 150 landowners in the last past 5 years, and planted over 200,000 trees (150,000 since 2014).As identified in the GWWA Wintering Grounds Conservation Plan, the conservation goals for the focal areas that we are working in are to establish protections for 10% of forest cover, restore 10% of existing pasture, and convert 10% of all sun coffee to shade coffee. Additionally, there is a goal to reduce the current deforestation rate by 50% over the next 5 years. The long-term goal of this project is to secure wintering habitat for the golden-winged warbler and wood thrush in Nicaragua. Our long term economic model is to develop sufficient shade coffee production to ensure economic viability of the production methodology for the landowner.This project is being conducted in conjunction with significant conservation efforts being led by ABC on the GWWA breeding grounds in the Great Lakes and Appalachia regions of the US, to ensure conservation of the complete annual life cycle of this species. ABC has other efforts taking place on the wintering grounds of this species in Honduras and Colombia.",

To act on that commitment, the government has joined the Alianza por el Mill\u00f3n, a public-private partnership led by the Ministry of Environment (MiAmbiente) and consisting of civil society organizations, the government and the private sector. The Alliance is restoring land through four approaches: natural forest conservation, the restoration of forests in riparian areas, the restoration of degraded lands, and sustainable commercial forestry.Since the program began, more than 5 million native trees have been planted throughout the country, with a survival rate of 70%. Thanks to this work, restoration has begun on over 40,000 hectares of degraded and deforested land.\u00a0Restoring over 13% of the country's total land area is daunting, but the Alliance is critical to meeting Panama's climate goals. Boosting tree cover on the 37% of Panama's land that is degraded will sequester carbon and provide a host of ecosystem services. But that's not all; the social and economic benefits are also massive.In June 2014, the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Panama (CCIP), working with civil society partners, formed the alliance because private sector leaders believed that restoring degraded land can make good business sense. They joined the National Reforestation and Allied Association of Panama (ANARAP), the National Association for the Conservation of Nature (ANCON), and other civil society organizations. On October 15 of that year, Panama's President, Juan Carlos Varela, signed an agreement with CCIP, ANARAP, and ANCON to kickstart the Alliance, with support from the ministries of environment, agricultural development, and commerce.The Alliance, supported by several techinical partners like CATIE, has hosted several tree-planting days, held webinars on encouraging a business approach to restoration, and participated in a regional workshop on monitoring run by technical partner GIZ. Panama has also become a critical partner of Initiative 20x20, in which it consistently participates and exchanges best practices with other partners. Since 2015, the Alliance has hosted an annual National Day of Reforestation, where Panamanians plant trees and learn about the benefits of healthy and resilient forests. During the 2018 event alone, almost 50,000 volunteers planted 78,000 trees. President Valera highlighted that restoring Panama is critical to the growth of the country's burgeoning ecotourism industry and for the implementation of both the National Strategy for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change and the National Water Security Plan 2015-2050. In the future, the Alliance will continue to work with civil society groups, local communities, the government, and private investors to scale up landscape restoration throughout Panama.",

By combining natural forest restoration and the management of existing forests with planting new forests and silvopastoral systems, the company creates added value. Shared value is an important dimension of the business plan. Land is mainly rented from local family farms and the profits, as well as the management of the land, are shared with the land owner.Aside from the expansion of food production, PAYCO has reforested 8,000 ha of land and plans to restore an additional 20,000 hectares of land by 2026. UNIQUE developed the forest restoration activities in a joint venture with PAYCO and is responsible for the technical management of the program. Informed by best practices, innovative forestry production schemes have been established, and today, the consortium is the largest forest reforestation initiative in Paraguay. The company's environmental stewardship is also documented in annual sustainability reports, and the reforested areas are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).By strictly implementing a \"site-species-market\" approach that prioritizes tree species diversity, the most appropriate silvicultural management regime, and optimal value chain organization, the project generates value for both landowners and clients.

Biofuel manufactured from the vegetable oil can be refined into diesel fuel. Investancia benefits from the biofuel revenue, while trees planted on pastureland will sequester carbon, improve soil fertility and reduce animal stress. Finally, these new agricultural activities will provide jobs and positively impact local communities. The vegetable oil meets the growing biofuel demand while the trees capture and store greenhouse gases.In addition to the environmental and economic potential, the silvopastoral model can improve cattle farming. A study conducted in Nicaragua and Costa Rica analyzed what happens when trees are added to pastureland. Thanks to the shade from trees, animal productivity can also improve. The switch from treeless pasture to land with a tree canopy cover of 20% increased meat yields by 10%.Silvopasture will also improve the sustainability of the meat industry in Paraguay and potentially provide a competitive advantage to cattle ranchers fighting for their place in global commodity supply chains. Refrigeration companies and European food and leather retailers are under pressure to certify the origins of their animal products and to think about sustainability and ethical production in their supply chains. The demand for meat, leather and animal co-products from farmers that also reforest land is expected to grow in the coming years. Investancia's silvopastoral model is expected to generate long-term economic opportunities for private companies, cattle farmers and local populations throughout Latin America.Canopy is starting small with 10,000 hectares, but the sheer size of the cattle industry in Latin America presents a large opportunity to scale up this type of profitable restoration. Canopy will continue to expand its restoration efforts in Paraguay.",

The Alliance was originally initiated by CARANA Corporation, USAID, Peru's National Commission for Development and Life without Drugs (DEVIDA), ECOM Agroindustrial Corp, Romex Trading and Acopagro (a cooperative). CARANA, an Initiative 20x20 partner, is a leader and manager of the Peru Cocoa Alliance.An initial $36 million investment from the Alternative Development program of USAID has enabled Alliance members to:Through these interventions, the Alliance has improved over 26,000 hectares.

        "descriptions": "The Tambopata National Reserve in the Madre de Dios region of Peru is located between the fringes of the Amazon rainforest and the city of Puerto Maldonado. The land here had become degraded through both illegal mining and the single crop plantations of papaya that provided the community with much needed income but stripped the soil of nutrients. This type of practice led to deforestation, as farmers moved on in search of new plots of nutrient-rich land, often forested.These scenarios are rapidly changing due to a groundbreaking project to transform agriculture in the southeastern region of Peru run by local, non-governmental organization AIDER and supported by impact investor and leading global natural capital fund manager, [AF, part of Mirova, an affiliate of Natixis Investment Managers and a financial partner of Initiative 20x20. [AF has invested in Ecosphere+, a leading company that is building a market for the environmental assets yielded by the fund, such as carbon credits, as well as for sustainably produced agricultural products, such as deforestation-free cocoa. Ecosphere+\u2019s customers, a variety of companies ranging from large corporations to small and medium-sized enterprises, use a price on carbon and the purchase of carbon credits to finance forest protection projects, including the work of AIDER, which allows them to align their actions with global climate and development goals.In 2014, AIDER supported the establishment of the Cooperativa de Servicios Multiples Tambopata Candamo (COOPASER), then a cooperative of 21 farmers. This has since grown to 350, a remarkable success story. AIDER works with farmers to develop individual business plans. For every 40 ha of land, including 20 of primary forest and 20 of crops, farmers must manage a minimum of 3 ha using these types of sustainable practices. To date, AIDER has restored and conserved 1,300 ha of forest within the Tambopata National Reserve buffer zone project.This US$ 12 million investment programme is creating an economic buffer zone around a 570,000 ha forest (an area of approximately the size of Los Angeles). By helping local farmers with the transition to sustainable cocoa production, degraded land is being restored and deforestation pressures relieved. This creates a barrier to protect the rainforest and provides people with a forest-friendly and sustainable livelihood, with income generated through the sale of both carbon credits and cocoa.AIDER receives carbon income from conserving virgin and secondary rainforest and managing the risk of buffer zone projects by engaging the local community in sustainable agriculture including agroforestry, instead of reforesting the area and fencing it off. The region has become an attractive opportunity for investors due to the lower risk of its carbon credits. Local people have incentives to restore and conserve land because of the benefit to their livelihoods, presenting a lower risk for the carbon credits economy of increasing tree and shrub cover to reduce emissions. In short, money raised from the carbon credits of forest conservation is funding the farmers\u2019 crops and agroforestry.",

The Cordillera Azul landscape is a rich biodiverse forest ecosystem that also stores a significant amount of carbon. A population of more than 250,000 people\u00a0organized in 400 communities live in the buffer zone around the Park's boundaries. Most are subsistence farmers and over 40% live in poverty. The Cordillera Azul National Park is also under constant threat from illegal logging and the agricultural encroachment from small, poor farmers who have no alternative means of income generation.Through an public-private partnership between the Peruvian government through the National Service of Protected Areas (SERNANP), the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Manejo de \u00c1reas Naturales (CIMA Cordillera Azul), and the Althelia Climate Fund, the Cordillera Azul National Park REDD+ Project is preserving more than 1.3 million hectares of pristine montane rainforest and supporting sustainable land use in the 2.5 million hectares that surround the Park. Cordillera is among one of the largest protected areas in Peru, bigger than the US state of Connecticut and is home to around 6,000 plant species, more than 80 large and medium mammal species, around 180 species of fish, and over\u00a0600\u00a0species of birds.The project will protect the area's unique biodiversity and restore degraded lands with cocoa and coffee agroforestry systems throughout the buffer zone around the Park. By working with small farmers and local communities, it will avoid more than 15 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over 6 years, mostly due to reduced deforestation.This project protects critical ecosystem services for local communities which rely on healthy, functioning soil and water for their survival. The Park also protects cloud forests and the headwaters of the Huallaga and Ucayali rivers, providing clean water, halting soil erosion, maintaining fertile soils. Cordillera Azul National Park is also home to indigenous populations that have chosen to remain in voluntary isolation. The protection of these populations and their choices is central to the project.Althelia's main partner for the Cordillera Azul REDD+ project is CIMA-Cordillera Azul, a Peruvian NGO and Initiative 20x20 technical partner, with over 12 years of on-the-ground experience managing protected areas. In 2008, the Peruvian government awarded CIMA a 20-year contract to manage the Park through a participatory process with different stakeholders, including international agencies, regional governments, local municipalities and farmer associations. CIMA is responsible for implementing conservation and protection activities inside the Park and its buffer zone, and ensuring the protected area's long-term financial sustainability.With loan-based financing, Althelia Climate Fund has committed \u20ac8.55 million over 6 years to enable the protection of the Cordillera Azul landscape. CIMA will enhance surveillance, biological monitoring, research, and institutional strengthening and improve the governance of communities living in the buffer zone. CIMA will also contribute to the development of sustainable economic activities.\u00a0The project encourages local communities to restore degraded land by creating sustainable agroforestry systems that combine food crops with sustainable cash crops, like cocoa and coffee, to support poverty reduction, in partnership with local farmers' cooperatives. Althelia, CIMA, their partners and local communities will continue to protect this rich landscape for generations to come.",

In the Ucayali region, the land has become so degraded that it was largely abandoned in the 1990s. In 2008, Peruvian company Bosques Amazonicos SAC(BAM) bought Campo Verde, an 18,000 hectare parcel of land overrun by exotic grasses, a far cry from the lush tropical forest that thrived only a few decades earlier.BAM wanted to invest in the future of the land and of the local communities living on its borders. On average, those farmers make less than $2 per day from the cattle and cash crops that they raise. The company saw a prosperous future where reforesting the land exclusively with high-value native tree species, including the locally extinct mahogany tree, could help those farmers and turn a profit. By sustainably harvesting the trees a few at a time, the company hoped that it could create prosperity for the long term while storing carbon and providing habitat for unique plants and animals.The company trained local farmers to sustainably manage forests, log the right trees at the right time to minimize harm to the ecosystem while maximizing value, avoid deforestation, and manage tree nurseries. BAM worked with Initiative 20x20 partner AIDER, a Peruvian NGO with deep local knowledge, to develop the field activities and measure progress.After a decade of hard work, BAM has restored 930 ha of degraded pasture, improved a further 268 ha of secondary forests, and revitalized 124 hectares through protection and assisted natural regeneration (where people help already growing plants mature faster). The project has employed over 400 people from the surrounding communities and provided internship and learning opportunities for more than 3,000 students.By planting leguminous trees that increase the nutrients in the soil, the process of restoration accelerated, transforming the barren landscape in only a few years. Overall, 2,040 ha of land has benefited from BAM's investment. The result? Water flows from the plantation into the surrounding rivers, soil quality has improved, and more wildlife move in and around Campo Verde than ever before.The climate impact of BAM's work is also clear. The company was also able to generate nearly 170,000 carbon credits to sell on the international market (before phasing the process out because of rising costs) and achieved gold level certification from Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA). The project also won first place at the national \u201cGood Practices on the Restoration of Degraded Areas\u201d contest organized by the Peruvian Forest Service (SERFOR) and the FAO in 2016.In the coming years, other companies and producers in the Ucayali region are planning to replicate the model, building off of BAM's success. Restoring land with native trees could soon be big business for rural Peru.",

That is partially because the people of the country's San Mart\u00edn region, in the foothills of the Andes, have access to few alternative economic opportunities.That is why an alliance of community organizations and companies have come together to protect and restore this biodiversity hotspot. The Alto Huayabamba project aims to connect multiple national parks and conservation corridors in the region, protecting the habitat of many endangered plants and animals. Local organization Asociaci\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nicos por la Amazon\u00eda (AMPA) is helping farmers produce crops sustainably, effectively manage the land through environmental education programs, and improve local governance.What impact has the project had so far? It has directly protected and restored over 143,000 hectares of land. AMPA has helped farmers grow quinoa, a local and traditional crop that doesn't degrade the land, as an economic alternative to expanding pasture for ranching. Since 2016, their production has been certified as organic. Now, Red de Energ\u00eda del Per\u00fa S.A. (REP), one of the subsidiaries of Initiative 20x20 partner ISA has also helped AMPA's beekeeping program that provides a new source of income to help conserve the land. Through its participatory approach to community involvement, the project has created 8 jobs and trained 40 local people on biodiversity monitoring and provided improved cookstoves to 24 households.The availability and flow of water in the upper basin of the Huayabamba River, which supplies water for many people living downriver, has improved. And the carbon sequestration potential of the project, more than 2 million tons of CO2, is also impressive - and potentially profitable. Through the support of ISA's Conexi\u00f3n Jaguar since 2018, the project is looking into carbon credits as a new way to finance and scale up the work. From improving local livelihoods to protecting biodiversity, Alto Huayabamba is making conservation and restoration work for people and the planet.",

At the same time, Carpish will sustain ongoing economic activities in the region by protecting the water supply and plants with medicinal value.The Hu\u00e1nuco Regional Government, Peruvian Ministry of Environment, Peruvian Protected Area Service (SERNANP), and local leaders all led this conservation effort and made this area a reality. The establishment of Carpish also would not have been possible without Nature and Culture International, who\u00a0helped facilitate\u00a0the on-the-ground work needed to create Carpish, and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, which financially supported this work with Andes Amazon Fund.",
